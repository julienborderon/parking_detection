Parking Detection from Aerial Images 

We developed an algorithm for parking detection in aerial images combining the YOLO V8 (https://docs.ultralytics.com/) model with Meta's SAM (https://segment-anything.com/) algorithm enables accurate and efficient parking detection in complex aerial scenes.

Object detection in aerial images has evolved significantly with advancements in computer vision and machine learning. Early approaches in the 1990s relied on feature-based methods, such as the Viola-Jones cascade detector using Haar-like features. However, the advent of deep learning in the early 2010s revolutionized object detection with YOLO's real-time, end-to-end approach, delivering high accuracy.

Challenges in Parking Detection:

Detecting parking spaces in aerial images is a burgeoning research area with potential applications in parking management and smart urban planning. The task is challenging due to:

1. **Parking Variability**: Parking spaces come in different shapes, sizes, and layouts, making fixed feature extraction difficult.

2. **Shadows and Lighting**: Aerial images may have shadows and variable lighting conditions, altering texture and colors.

3. **Obstacles and Occlusion**: Urban environments with buildings, trees, or vehicles can obscure parking spaces.

4. **Parking Size**: Parking spaces may be small compared to the overall image, making detection at an appropriate scale crucial.

5. **Vehicle Diversity**: Parked vehicles vary in shape, size, and orientation, adding complexity.

## training 
We decided to train YOLO V8 small on aerial images of parking that we obtained by crossing the openstreetmap database and the IGN TOPO database ( https://geoservices.ign.fr/documentation/donnees/vector/bdtopo). 
We used data from 6 departments : Ain, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne, Gard, Lot and Var.

We have a dataset composed of 2510 images with 7242 parking for the train set, 539 images and 1651 parking for the validation set and finally 537 images and 1573 parking for the test set.

With 300 epochs we obtaint the next results :
